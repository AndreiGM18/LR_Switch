# Switch Implementation

**Name: Mitran Andrei-Gabriel**
**Group: 333CA**

## Organization

* The switch can handle forwarding with learning, and has support for VLANs and
STP.

## Implementation

* Forwarding with learning and STP are done with the algorithms provided by the
team.
* When it comes to how the MAC table and VLAN associations of each port are
stored, it is done using two dictionaries.
* A trunk port is marked with sys.maxsize.
* Every time a packet comes from an access port, the switch tags it and removes
it only if it is sent to another access port.
* When handling BPDU packets, a custom packet is sent that simply contains an
indetifier (int: 25), root_bridge_id, sender_bridge_id and sender_path_cost,
the latter 3 having being described in the pseudocode.
* I only send BPDU packets when the switch is root. If the switch learns that
it is not in fact root, I signal the thread to stop, as no switches are turned
off.

### Compilation

* Code is written in Python, therefore it is not needed.

### Resources

* Everything provided by the RL team
